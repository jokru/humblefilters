# Humblefilters
This is a browser extension (currently) for firefox, which enabled different filters for items available on the humbldebundle website and humble store. Filters include:
- Steam owned games marking
- Steam wishlisted games highlighting
- Marking all but selected platform

Available on [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/humble-store-filters/)

# Current issues
- Games on a wrong platform, but wishlisted on steam show both css styles (no picture, strikethrough text, but highlighted color)
