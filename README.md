# Humblefilters
This is a browser extension (currently) for firefox, which enabled different filters for items available on the humbldebundle website and humble store. Filters include:
- Steam owned games marking
- Steam wishlisted games highlighting
- Marking all but selected platform


#  TODO:
- Improve options css
- Make different filters optional
- Make chrome version with polyfill
- Some games may have different names on humlbe and steam

# Current issues
- Games on a wrong platform, but wishlisted on steam show both css styles (no picture, strikethrough text, but highlighted color)
- Getting DLC data is not possible (for some DLC at least, like the skyrim anniversary edition)
